**VENUE:** The School will take place on University of Michigan's Central Campus in Ann Arbor, MI. The lectures will take place in the brand new [Central Campus Classroom Building](https://cccb.provost.umich.edu/). We will enable the meeting for hybrid attendance, and there will be a dedicated Zoom link for remote participants to dial into talks. The map of central campus, with CCCB clearly labeled, is [HERE](/assets/images/campus_map.png).

**LODGING:** Most of you will likely want to use services Airbnb or Hotels.com which offer numerous options on and near campus. Note that the fancy hotels that are very near Central Campus such as [Bell Tower](https://belltowerhotel.com/), [Michigan League](https://inn.studentlife.umich.edu/rooms/), or [Graduate by Hilton](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/arbgagu-graduate-ann-arbor/) are pricey (ballpark $300/night or more!) but, if you can afford them or if you can share a room, are a great option. On a more budget-friendly side, we have booked a block of rooms (click [HERE](https://tinyurl.com/3nhsmrey)) at the Hampton Inn Ann Arbor South at $139/room (with sharing possible, which would further decrease cost); the hotel offers a bus transportation to central campus. Another good option, a little pricey but very nice, are [Exhibit A2 apartments](https://exhibita2.com/) which can be shared by ~3 students at a reasonable cost, and are very near the School venue.  We will provide a spreadsheet where students can sign up to find roommates in the very near future.

**TRAVEL:** You can find lots of information on the [LCTP visitor info site](https://lsa.umich.edu/lctp/visitor-information.html). Probably the most important thing to know is that the closest airport is the Detroit Metro Airport (DTW), which is 30-40 mins away by taxi/Uber and has good flight connections worldwide. 

By far the cheapest way to get from the airport to the city is [Michigan Flyer bus](https://www.michiganflyer.com/) which brings you to the Blake Transit Center in downtown Ann Arbor. An Uber ride from the airport costs $50-60. A taxi should cost $70 or so. And if you want to travel in style, a [Metrocar](https://metropolitanairportcars.com/) (with a uniformed driver) should cost slightly more, in the $85 ballpark.

There are also buses which are cheaper. This bus route, run by the [Michigan Flyer](https://www.theride.org/services/airport-service), is by far the cheapest mode of transport to and from the airport (the cost is $15 or so) to Ann Arbor and you can book your seat online ahead of time. The bus runs from both terminals at DTW and drops you off at Blake Transit Center in downtown Ann Arbor, a short walk from the site of the school. In case your hotel is not within walking distance from there, taking the Flyer to Ann Arbor and then getting an Uber ride to the hotel is a good option. The only limitation is the limited daytime schedule of the bus, given [here](https://www.michiganflyer.com/schedule-route). For arriving in Ann Arbor, refer to the Westbound table. For returning to DTW, refer to the Eastbound one.


**WHERE TO EAT/DRINK IN ANN ARBOR:** Our students and postdocs have created [THIS DOC](/assets/images/2025_Guide_to_A2.docx.pdf) for more information on where to eat, drink, have coffee, or what to do in Ann Arbor.
